#nrama

note-o-rama firefox extension

Essentially, this creates a button that injects the note-o-rama contentscript (same code base as the note-o-rama bookmarklet) into pages.
The advantage of an extension is that username and password are secured (insecurely at present).

The source of the note-o-rama bookmarklet / contentscript / page implant is in a separate project, 'nrama3_core_scripts'.
